vim.o -> :set
vim.keymap.set -> map 
    + applied to normal(n), visual(v), insert(i) and command(c) mode
    + :nmap dd O<esc>jddk: "dd" appears twice, which will make this keymap recursive -> noremap = true

- "bufhidden" -> what happpens when a window is no longer displayed in the current window
    + bufhidden=wipe -> clear all data when the buffer is hidden

- Moving around in created windows is good, doesn't need any function to perform that task
- Type "vim.api.buf" to reveal supported buffer's functions
- vim.api.nvim_list_bufs -> list all bufs (equivalent to :ls!)
    + vim.api.nvim_buf_is_loaded -> validate the buf and check if it's loaded
- vim.api.buf_set_lines -> push lines to a buf (use end=-1 to push as much as wanted)
- ipairs(lua) ~ enumerate(python)
- vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor -> get the location of the cursor in the current chosen window as (row, column)
- vim.api.nvim_buf_create_user_command -> those commands will be effective for the selected buf
- vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap -> ALWAYS use "opts = { noremap = true }", those keymaps will be effective for the selected buf
- "table" in lua use 1-based index
- vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines -> use 0-based index

-- #HOW TO TEST THE MODULE
Calls out the function needed testing -> use the "source" command in neovim to run the lua file

-- #NOTES
use #table -> show length of a table
use print(table.concat(table, "\n")) -> print out the content of a table in each different line
do not call any function/method explicitly in any lua file to prevent them being executed by LazyVim
can attach "autocmd" to any buffer
