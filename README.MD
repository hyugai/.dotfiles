NEOVIM'S SETTING-UP FOR PYTHON IN UBUNTU 24.04 (WSL2)

Some notes:
- I'm using the default terminal in Windows 11 24H2.
- There are some packages in "requirements.txt" file you should install for some purposes as I commented in there. 
- To use virtual environments (e.g Anaconda, Miniconda), you should activate it first.
